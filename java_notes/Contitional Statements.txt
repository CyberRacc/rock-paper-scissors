Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for
different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

 - if - use to specify a block of code to be execuded, if a specified condition is true.
 - else - Use to specify a block of code to be execuded is the same condition is false.
 - else if - Use to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
 - switch - Use to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

 ## The if statement ##

if (condition) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true.
}

Must be lowercase.

Example: Make a "Good day" greeting if the hour is less than 18:00:

if (hour < 18) {
    greeting = "Good day";
}

The result of the greeting will be:

Good day

## The else statement ##

if (condition) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

Example - If the hour is less than 18, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise "Good evening":

if (hour < 18) {
    greeting = "Good day";
} else {
    greeting = "Good evening";
}

The result of the greeting will be "Good day" before 18:00 and "Good evening" after 18:00.

## The else if statement ##

if (condition1) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true.
} else {
    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is false.
}

Example - If time is less than 10:00, create a "Good morning" greeting,
if not, but time is less than 20:00, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise a "Good evening:

if (time < 10) {
    greeting = "Good morning";
} else if (time < 20) {
    greeting = "Good day";
} else {
    greeting = "Good evening";
}
