String: A sequence of characters in single or double quotes.

Function: A block of reusable code that performs a specific task.
They are a way to group code into sub-programs that can be called.

An example of a basic function:

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}

in the above example, greet is the name of the function.
There are no parameters though as the brackets next to greet are empty.
When called it prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

You can call it by using its name with brackets.
greet(); // Outputs: Hello, world!

Functions can also take parameters, which are variables that are used
as imputs to the function, an example:

function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name  + "!");
}

in the above example, name is a paremeter, when the function is called,
you can pass in an argument for this parameter:

greet("Alice"); //m Outputs: Hello, Alice!
