## Introduction ##

    Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to
    run JavaScript outside of your web browser. We will need this
    for some exercises in the upcoming lessons.
    To get started, there are some required tools we need before we
    can install Node on your system.

    We're going to install it using nvm (Node Version Manager),
    because it makes it easy to change Node versions and upgrade
    Node. There is another tool called npm (Node Package Manager)
    that you will use later to install the various libraries and
    tools used in JavaScript environments. It can be easy to
    confuse these two, so ready carefully!

    Node is also very easy to install using nvm, so this should go
    quickly :)
