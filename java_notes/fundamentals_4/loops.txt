## Looping Code ##

    Programming languages are very useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, from multiple
    basic calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar
    items of work to complete. Here we'll look at the loop structures available in
    JavaScript that handle such needs.

    ## Why are loops useful? ##

    Loops are all about doing the same thing over and over again. Often, the code will be
    slightly different each time round the loop, or the same code will run but with
    different variables.

## Looping through a collection ##

    Most of the time when you use a loop, you will have a collection of items and want to do
    something with every item.

    One type of collection is the Array. But there are other collections in JavaScript as well,
    including Set and Map.

## The for...of loop ##

    The basic tool for looping through a collection is the for...of loop:

    const cats = ["Leapard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

    for (const cat of cats) {
        console.log(cat);
    }

    In this example, for (const cat of cats) says:

        1. Given the collection of cats, get the first item in the collection.

        2. Assign it to the variable cat and then run the code between the curly brackets {}.

        3. Get the next item, and repeat (2) until you've reached the end of the collection.

## map() and filter() ##

    JavaScript also has more specialised loops for collections, and we'll mention two of
    them here.

    You can use map() to do something to each item in a collection and create a new
    collection containing the changed items:

        function toUpper(string) {
            return string.toUpperCase();
        }

        const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

        const upperCats = cats.map(toUpper);

        console.log(upperCats);
        // [ "LEOPARD", "SERVAL", "JAGUAR", "TIGER", "CARACAL", "LION" ]

    
    Here we pass a function into cats.map(), and map() calls the function once for each item
    in the array, passing in the item. It then adds the return value from each function call
    to a new array, and finally returns the new array. In this case the fucntion we provide
    converts the item to uppercase, so the resulting arary contains all our cats in uppercase.

    You can use filter() to test each item in a collection, and create a new collection
    containing only items that match:

        function lCat(cat) {
            return cat.startsWith("l");
        }

        const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

        const filtered = cats.filter(lcat);

        console.log(filtered);
        // ["Leadpard", "Lion"]
