## Pseudocode ##

    Pseudocode is writing out the logic for your program in natural language instead
    of code. It helps you slow down and think through the steps your program will
    have to go through to solve the problem.

    Here's an example of what the pseudocode for a simple program that prints all
    numbers up to an inputted number might look like:

    1. When the user enters a number
    2. Initialise a counter variable and set its value to zero
    3. While counter is smaller than user inputted number, increment the counter
    by one.
    4. Print the value of the counter variable.

    This is a very simple program to demonstrate how pseudocode looks.
